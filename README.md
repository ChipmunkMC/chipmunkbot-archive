# chipmunkbot-archive
Real ChipmunkBot source code. The code is probably very inconsistent and messy but it should work. Also, I planned on releasing it a while ago but i was too lazy :skull:. I will eventually rewrite the bot from scratch. Also, the `index.js` was rewritten a bit to add support for external configuration (yes, it was hardcoded before).
